Boozang Functional Overview
============

In this functional overview document we will go over and explain the different functions of the Boozang test tool.
This document will be updated as the Boozang test service evolves and an updated copy can always be found on GitHub:

The Navigation
------------
The Boozang test tools allows you to organize your project into modules and test cases. The project can contain one or many modules, which in turn contain one or many test cases. A typical example could be: an E-Commerce project such as the Angular Store, would contain modules such as Navigation, Store and
Landing Pages. In Navigation you would find test cases such as Header Navigation, Sidebar Navigation, Main Search, where functionality related to navigation would be found. In Store, you would find test cases for Add Item To Cart, Checkout Items, Clear Cart, etc. Below is a picture of the Boozang navigation bar for the Interactive Tutorial "Angular Store", where you can see the modules Fruit Interactive Tutorial and Your Space. As the Fruit Interactive Tutorial module has been expanded, we can see the test cases 'Add Random Fruits" and "Fruit Test" inside.

On the top you can see the operations (from left to right): Create New Module, Create New Test, Paste, Cut, and Copy. In the tree structure, the folder
 icons to the left of the module name shows if the module is expanded or not. To the left of the test name the icon shown denotes the test type. The test type can be either cell test, unit test, integration test or bug.

The Function Bar
------------
![example image](images/annotated_panel.png "An exemplary image")

Here is an explanation of the functions:

Create Folder
 : Creates a folder in the test tree to keep your tests sorted

Create Test
 : Creates a new test. This creates an empty test which unlocks all test actions

Record
 : Records actions into the tests by registering events in the browser. The events being registered can be set in Settings (in hamburger menu)

Play
 : Runs the test

Step
 : Runs the test one step at a time

Stop
 : Stops current test run

Validate
 : Creates a validation, or in test language, assertion in the page

Comment
 : Creates a comment text box in the page. Useful to point out bugs and discrepancies
9. Fill Form: Fills out form and enables binding into JSON data structures
10. Cancel/Unlock: Reloads test from server. Local changes will be lost and lock removed
11. Save: Saves to server database. In order to release lock follow with cancel

Settings
------------
The Settings panel can be found in the Hamburger menu in the top right corner. The Settings are divided into tabs: General, Recording Events, Dom Strategy,
Validation Ignore, Subscription, Service. As soon as you update any settings in needs to be Saved to take effect. This will affect your user only,
and will persist between sessions for your user. If it's desired to change a setting for the whole project, use Save As Default. This change will be set 
on the project level and will affect all new sessions for other users. Note: Save As Default require Modify-privileges on the Project-level.

### General ###

![example image](images/settings_general.png "An exemplary image")

The General Settings tab allows the user to control basic test functionality and look & feel. Explanation of functions from top to bottom

Default Root URL
 : This is defines the starting point of your application relative to the bz.html-fragment. This means: the normal case when the bz.html is located in 
the same directory as index.html, this should be "/" or blank. Another common configuraion is when the bz.html is located in the root, and my index.httml is located one directory down, as the example "angular-shop". This will allow the "angular-shop" to be the default entry point. 

IDE Path
 : This is the exact path to the bz.html. This will help you finding the local test URL when inviting new users to the team. 

Pop Window Style
 : This allows you to put custom CSS for the tool-set window. By doing this the tool can be sized and positioned the same way every time it is launched.

Wait Threshold
 : Wensheng

Step Interval
 : This is the step delay when re-playing a test in slow mode.

Data Page URL
 : Wensheng

Checkboxes

Auto Show Test Report after testing
 : This means test report will be shown after each test run.

Auto Pop Dom Picker when the best DOM path can not be found
 : When there isn't a unique DOM path found, this will pop the DOM picker to allow you to further specify the exact DOM path desired.

### Recording Events###
This settings tab allows the user to control which events should be captured when recording. 

![example image](images/settings_recording.png "An exemplary image")

Explanation of functions from top to bottom

Events
 : Specifies which events should be captured in the recording process. 

Mousemove step
 : This specifies how often a new event should be captured when doing drag-and-drop. 50 px means that in order to test drag and drop, it will generate 
a new event every 50 px. 

Method
 : It's here possible to allow the user to show the DOM tree mask when recording. This will highlight the exact element in the DOM tree where the 
trigger event is generated.

Checkboxes

Ignore Click on Input
 : Wensheng

### DOM Strategy###

This is arguably the most important setting of the Boozang tool. The DOM Strategy allows you to configure how the tool uniquely identifies an
element in the DOM tree. As DOM tree conventions vary between different sites, this is something that is typically done once per project and left untouched.
Having a correct DOM tree strategy will determine how well the tool will work.

![example image](images/settings_dom.png "An exemplary image")

Explanation of functions from top to bottom

Id
 : Determine if you want to catch the Id attribute in the DOM tree. If you have unique ids that are non-dynamic, use First and leave the second field
blank. To support dynamic Ids, you can use Regexp ignore. As can be seen in the example, the Regexp ignore [0-9] matches on the characters in the ids and ignores numbers.

Class
 : Determines if you want to include the class when navigating the DOM tree. In the second field you can specify which classes to ignore. 

Attribute
 : Sets one or many special attributes to include when matching.

Contains text
 : In some cases, when ids cannot be enforced on all items, it's sometimes useful to match on the contents of an element. 

DOM
 : Wensheng 

### Validation Ignore###

Sets the default attributes that are ignored when creating a validation. The attributes not ignored will be included in the asserts-equals condition 
being build when doing a validation. This can also be set on each validation action, but the setting here should will allow the user to do one-click validations without doing further changes.

![example image](images/settings_validation.png "An exemplary image")

Ignore
 : The default attributes that should be ignored when doing validations. 

Other Attributes
 : Any other (custom) attributes that should be ignored 

Other Elements
 : Any other elements that should be ignored

### Subscriptions ###

This allows you to setup email notification for test runs. The options are self-explanatory.

Data handling
------------

Note that --- not considering the asterisk --- the actual text
content starts at 4-columns in.

> Block quotes are
> written like so.
>
> They can span multiple paragraphs,
> if you like.

Use 3 dashes for an em-dash. Use 2 dashes for ranges (ex., "it's all
in chapters 12--14"). Three dots ... will be converted to an ellipsis.
Unicode is supported. â˜º



An h2 header
------------

Here's a numbered list:

 1. first item
 2. second item
 3. third item

Note again how the actual text starts at 4 columns in (4 characters
from the left side). Here's a code sample:

    # Let me re-iterate ...
    for i in 1 .. 10 { do-something(i) }

As you probably guessed, indented 4 spaces. By the way, instead of
indenting the block, you can use delimited blocks, if you like:

~~~
define foobar() {
    print "Welcome to flavor country!";
}
~~~

(which makes copying & pasting easier). You can optionally mark the
delimited block for Pandoc to syntax highlight it:

~~~python
import time
# Quick, count to ten!
for i in range(10):
    # (but not *too* quick)
    time.sleep(0.5)
    print i
~~~



### An h3 header ###

Now a nested list:

 1. First, get these ingredients:

      * carrots
      * celery
      * lentils

 2. Boil some water.

 3. Dump everything in the pot and follow
    this algorithm:

        find wooden spoon
        uncover pot
        stir
        cover pot
        balance wooden spoon precariously on pot handle
        wait 10 minutes
        goto first step (or shut off burner when done)

    Do not bump wooden spoon or it will fall.

Notice again how text always lines up on 4-space indents (including
that last line which continues item 3 above).

Here's a link to [a website](http://foo.bar), to a [local
doc](local-doc.html), and to a [section heading in the current
doc](#an-h2-header). Here's a footnote [^1].

[^1]: Footnote text goes here.

Tables can look like this:

size  material      color
----  ------------  ------------
9     leather       brown
10    hemp canvas   natural
11    glass         transparent

Table: Shoes, their sizes, and what they're made of

(The above is the caption for the table.) Pandoc also supports
multi-line tables:

--------  -----------------------
keyword   text
--------  -----------------------
red       Sunsets, apples, and
          other red or reddish
          things.

green     Leaves, grass, frogs
          and other things it's
          not easy being.
--------  -----------------------

A horizontal rule follows.

***

Here's a definition list:

apples
  : Good for making applesauce.
oranges
  : Citrus!
tomatoes
  : There's no "e" in tomatoe.

Again, text is indented 4 spaces. (Put a blank line between each
term/definition pair to spread things out more.)

Here's a "line block":

| Line one
|   Line too
| Line tree

and images can be specified like so:

![example image](example-image.jpg "An exemplary image")

Inline math equations go in like so: $\omega = d\phi / dt$. Display
math should get its own line and be put in in double-dollarsigns:

$$I = \int \rho R^{2} dV$$

And note that you can backslash-escape any punctuation characters
which you wish to be displayed literally, ex.: \`foo\`, \*bar\*, etc.
