Key Differences
============

A natural language approach
------------
Boozang is fundamentally different from other test tools. Boozang using natural language to identify browser elements, instead of the DOM elements, making tests incredibly stable to technological changes. Actually, itÂ´s possible to completely change the underlying technology without affecting the tests. You can go from a Java legacy application to Angular and the tests remains the same, as long as the business requirments does.
