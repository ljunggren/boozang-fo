Why use data?
============

Problems with "normal" recording of forms
-----------------------------------------
Recording is an amazing way to quickly automate navigation and other mouse or keyboard actions. When it comes to form input, this is not ideal. The main reason for this is if you want to record filling a form with a large number of different data sets this amounts to a large number of test cases. Again, creating these different test cases requires manual labour, and this gets tedious and many test cases gets expensive to maintain. Which defies the whole point of automation - getting away from repetitive work.

A new type of record
--------------------
Luckily, Boozang introduces a new type of record where data is captured in "variables" completly separate from the recorded actions. This means a test case can be fed with different types of data, and in order to enter a large data set, like entering orders into a system, we can use "data loops".
