The Help function
============

SaaS and new features
---------------------
As Boozang is completely hosted in the Cloud itÂ´s easy to do changes and add useful features quickly. This has a huge upside as we are able to deploy features that customer asks for to all our customers at the same time, to the benefit of all. This also means that new things can appear in the user interface without warning, and in some cases, that the documentation might not be up-to-date all the time. 

In-tool help
------------
For this reason, to be able to deliver new features fast without forcing the end user to re-learn, we added an online help function inside the tool. Simply click the question mark in the user interface, and click the functionality and an explanation will appear. 

Videos
------
In the help text you will find an explanation of the function you selected. You will also find any related videos to that function, if available. When clicking a video link, a separate video window will appear and you will be able to follow along in the tool if needed.
